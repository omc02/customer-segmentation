# customer-segmentation

## Key Components

### 1. Importing Libraries
The project uses several Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, including:

- Pandas for data processing and CSV file I/O.
- NumPy for numerical operations.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- scikit-learn for applying KMeans clustering.

### 2. Loading and Exploring Data
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, enabling an initial exploration of its structure and contents. Key operations include reading data from an Excel file and examining the first few rows to understand the dataset's structure.

## Methodology

The project involves several stages, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning techniques for clustering customers.

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
This stage involves handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization of the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the distributions of various features and identify patterns and correlations in the dataset.

### 3. Customer Segmentation
The KMeans clustering algorithm is used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

## Conclusion and Insights

The final section of the project highlights the key insights derived from the customer segmentation analysis, including the characteristics of different customer segments and potential strategies for targeted marketing.

## Usage

Instructions for running the notebook and replicating the analysis are provided.
