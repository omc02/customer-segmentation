# customer-segmentation

## Key Components of the Project

### 1. Importing Libraries
This project utilizes specific Python libraries for efficient data handling and analysis:
- **Pandas**: Essential for data processing, manipulation, and CSV file I/O operations. It provides tools for reading and writing data in different formats.
- **NumPy**: Used for complex numerical operations, especially in array and matrix manipulations, which are crucial for data analysis.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: These libraries are instrumental in visualizing data, helping to generate informative plots and graphs for analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: A fundamental library for machine learning, used here primarily for implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm.

### 2. Loading and Exploring Data
The dataset, sourced from an online retail platform, is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. This step is critical for:
- Reading data efficiently from an Excel file (`Online Retail.xlsx`).
- Performing initial data inspection, including examining the first few rows to understand features like Invoice Numbers, Product Codes, Quantities, etc.

## Detailed Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The initial stage involves:
- Identifying and handling missing values, ensuring data quality.
- Detecting and treating outliers to prevent skewed analysis.
- Normalizing data to bring all variables to a common scale, which is essential for accurate clustering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this stage, we:
- Investigate the distributions of various features such as purchase frequency, product categories, and customer demographics.
- Identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data that could influence customer segmentation.

### 3. Customer Segmentation with KMeans
Utilizing the KMeans clustering algorithm, we segment customers based on criteria like:
- Purchase frequency and recency.
- Average transaction value.
- Product preferences and categories.
